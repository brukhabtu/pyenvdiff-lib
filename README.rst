Python environment comparison tool.

Sooo much room for activities!
------------------------------

* Compare dev, test & prod!
* Works on my machine, strange it doesn't work on yours
* Confirming deployments
* Auditing user desktops, servers, research environments & ecosystems
* Filing (or requesting) bug reports

Installation
------------

```
pip install pyenvdiff 
```

OR just copy & paste pyenvdiff anywhere on PYTHONPATH

Under the hood
--------------

* Zero dependency, pure-python, harmless `pip install pyenvdiff` or copy anywhere on PYTHONPATH.
* As-needed import statements, to maximize compatibility across python flavours.
* Favours compatible python-code over succinct or newer-style python-code

* Free software: BSD license
* Documentation: https://pyenvdiff.readthedocs.io.
